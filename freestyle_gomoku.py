# In this problem, you will implement two-player Freestyle Gomoku with the following specifications:
# a. The game must be implemented using only the Python standard library.
# b. The game must be able to be run from the command line/terminal. No frontend.
# c. The game must show the state and progression through ASCII graphics.
# d. Players must be able to keep playing without restarting the script.
# e. Players must be able to quit or give-up at any time.

# Use Flake8 to understand PEP 8
# Python Standard Library - https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/
